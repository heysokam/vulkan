# Notes: outputPath

# Futhark has an outputPath argument which can be added to the importc block.
# This path is where the completed bindings will be stored,
# and also where Futhark will look for existing bindings to avoid rebuilding them.

# You will need to use -d:futharkRebuild to update the file when you make changes in the importc block if the outputPath set to a file.

# If you set outputPath to a folder:
  # Futhark will store the files with the appended hash in this folder
  # instead of in the nimcache folder and caching will work as usual.

  # By using this feature you will be able to set a path local to your project
  # and check the generated Futhark file into your version control system.

  # But that is only half the job,
  # because to be aware of the cache file Futhark still needs to be installed.

  # The recommended way to get around this is to do a when defined(useFuthark) switch
  # to check whether the user wants to use Futhark directly or to use the shipped wrapper.

  # It is recommended to use the exact name useFuthark,
  # this way the user can turn on Futhark for the entire project (in case you have imported another library which also uses Futhark).

  # If you want to give the user the option to switch on Futhark for only your project
  # it is recommended to use an additional switch with useFutharkFor<project name>
