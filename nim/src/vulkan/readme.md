# Vulkan Bindings for Nim
Usage:
```nim
import vulkan as vk
vk.createInstance( ... )
```
> `Vk`, `vk` and `VK_` prefixes removed for ergonomics.  
> See the @[gen/config](./gen/cfg.nim) file for a complete list of renamed symbols.

> _Notes:_  
>  - _Generated with [Futhark](https://github.com/PMunch/futhark)_  
>  - _The `build.nim` file is unnecessary, unless you need to re-generate the bindings._
